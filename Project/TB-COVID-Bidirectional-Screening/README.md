# Bidirectional TB–COVID Screening: Yield and Cascade Performance (2020–2022)

> Evaluation of **TB case-finding efficiency** through integrated **COVID-19 and TB screening/testing** across 14 health facilities in Nairobi. The project assessed how bidirectional screening improved diagnostic yield and informed the institutionalization of integrated respiratory disease workflows.

**Methods:**  
- Descriptive **proportion and cascade analysis**  
- **Chi-square** tests for group differences  
- **Crude odds ratios (ORs)** with 95% confidence intervals  
- Sensitivity analysis to verify screening completeness across facilities

## 🖥️ Environment / Platforms
- **SQL Server** — data integration and cascade computation  
- **Laboratory systems** — data import from **PCR** and **GeneXpert** platforms  
- **Power BI Service** — interactive **TB–COVID cascade dashboard** for real-time facility performance tracking  

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Mapping screening tools** — harmonized TB and COVID-19 triage forms  
2. **Data integration** — developed SQL pipelines merging facility, lab, and EMR data  
3. **Cascade computation** — calculated presumptive, tested, and confirmed case yields  
4. **Regression analysis** — identified predictors of TB positivity among COVID-19 presumptive clients  
5. **Dissemination** — facility-level dashboards and national program briefs

## 📦 Key Outputs / Deliverables
- Integrated **TB–COVID cascade dashboard** (Power BI)  
- **Odds ratio tables** summarizing risk differentials  
- Facility-level **feedback and performance reports**  

---

## 📈 Results & Impact
- Clients with **presumptive COVID-19** had a **significantly higher TB yield**  
- Marked increases in **presumptive TB identification**, **diagnostic evaluation**, and **confirmed TB cases** among COVID-19 presumptive cohorts  
- Institutionalized **integrated respiratory screening** within EDARP and adopted by national TB program as best practice  

---

## 🔧 Lessons Learned / Future Improvements
- Need to **standardize triage data elements** across digital and paper tools  
- Develop **predictive alerts** for high-risk symptom combinations  
- Add **turnaround time monitoring** for diagnostic efficiency

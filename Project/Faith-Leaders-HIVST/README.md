# Faith-Led HIV Self-Testing: Case Identification & Linkage Gains (2019–2020)

> Evaluation of a **faith-leader–driven HIV self-testing (HIVST) program** implemented across 14 clinics in Nairobi’s informal settlements. The initiative leveraged trusted community faith leaders to increase HIV testing uptake, case identification, and linkage to ART, especially among men and other hard-to-reach populations.

## 👤 Role & Problem Statement
**Role:** *Data Analyst* — responsible for **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes, **trend analysis**, and **effect estimation**.  
**Problem solved:** Demonstrated that **faith-based HIVST distribution** can be a **scalable, high-yield model** for identifying new HIV cases and improving linkage outcomes in low-testing populations.

</p>

**Methods:**  
- **Pre–post analysis** to compare testing uptake and positivity rates  
- **Proportion tests** for yield differentials by sex and period  
- **Odds ratios (ORs)** for linkage comparisons  
- **Interrupted time series (ITS)** for trend validation and sustainability checks

## 🖥️ Environment / Platforms
- **SQL Server** — core ETL and data harmonization  
- **Call-center logs** — for follow-up and linkage verification  
- **Power BI Service** — dynamic dashboards and site performance visualizations  

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Data integration:** linked community HIVST distribution and clinic testing data  
2. **Define analysis periods:** established 6-month pre/post intervention windows  
3. **Compute testing yields and linkage rates:** disaggregated by sex and location  
4. **Stratify analysis:** examined differential performance across facilities  
5. **Dissemination:** presented summary dashboards, scorecards, and effect estimates to program teams and partners  

---

## 📦 Key Outputs / Deliverables
- **Site scorecards** ranking HIVST performance across facilities  
- **Yield and positivity visualizations** using Power BI dashboards  
- **Linkage tracking workbook** integrating follow-up logs and EMR data  

---

## 📈 Results & Impact
- **New diagnoses:**  
  - ↑ **117%** among men and **134%** among women post-intervention  
- **Testing yield:**  
  - Men: **1.2% → 2.8%**, Women: **1.7% → 4.1%**  
- **Operational impact:** Model scaled to additional sites and adopted by national HIV programs as a **best-practice faith-based strategy** for HIV testing and linkage.  

---

## 🔧 Lessons Learned / Future Improvements
- Sustain **hotline support** and **partner notification services (PNS)** for continuous linkage.  
- Assess **cost per case identified** for scale-up planning.  
- Explore **spillover modeling** to estimate indirect testing impacts within faith communities.

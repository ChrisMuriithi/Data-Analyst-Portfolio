# CQI for Rapid Linkage: 60% → 98% in Urban Informal Settlements (2011–2015)

> A three-phase **Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)** initiative implemented across **14 urban informal settlement facilities** to increase linkage to HIV care among newly diagnosed clients.  
> The project introduced structured escort services, appointment tracking, and literacy interventions that significantly reduced pre-enrollment loss to follow-up.

**Methods:**  
- **Pre–post analysis** for linkage improvement  
- **Logistic regression** to identify predictors of linkage success  
- **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** and **control charts** for QI monitoring

## 🖥️ Environment / Platforms
- **SQL Server:** central database integrating HIV testing and care registers  
- **Power BI Service:** real-time dashboards for QI metrics and progress tracking  
- **Excel/Power Query:** data cleaning and monthly facility aggregation  
- **QI registry:** structured monitoring for intervention phases  

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Define Key Performance Indicators (KPI):** linkage to ART initiation within 30 days.  
2. **Phase rollouts:**  
   - Phase 1 — *Physical escort of clients to care units*  
   - Phase 2 — *Tracking and tracing of missed appointments*  
   - Phase 3 — *HIV literacy and client support materials*  
3. **Analyze trends and predictors:** using STATA logistic regression and SPC charts.  
4. **Feedback loop:** monthly site data reviews with dashboards and learning sessions.

## 📦 Key Outputs / Deliverables
- **CQI registry** for facility-based tracking  
- **Predictor models** for client-level risk factors  
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for escort, tracking, and triage workflows  
- **Run charts and dashboards** visualizing phase impacts  

---

## 📈 Results & Impact
- **Linkage improved from 60% → 98% (p<0.0001)**  
- **Predictors of poor linkage:** adolescents, females, unemployed clients  
- **Positive predictors:** first-time testers, divorced clients  
- **Sustainability:** monthly CQI learning sessions institutionalized across all sites  
- **Policy relevance:** intervention model shared nationally as a best practice for linkage improvement  

---

## 🔧 Lessons Learned / Future Improvements
- Integrate **SMS reminders** for missed appointments.  
- Add **social worker triage** for high-risk clients.  
- Track **time-to-ART initiation** to complement linkage metrics.
